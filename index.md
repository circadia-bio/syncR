## 📖 What is syncR?

syncR provides a single, unified entry point for bringing together data
across the Circadia Lab package ecosystem. It pulls sociodemographic and
questionnaire data from **tallieR**, sleep diary data from **slumbR**,
and actigraphy-derived circadian metrics from **zeitR** into one tidy,
participant-indexed database.

> *syncR::sync() — pulling everything into alignment, just like the SCN
> does.*

Just as the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) coordinates biological rhythms
across the body, `syncR` coordinates data streams across the suite —
making cross-domain analysis (actigraphy vs. subjective sleep quality,
circadian phase vs. demographics) effortless.

## ✨ Features

- 🔗 **One function, three sources** —
  [`sync()`](https://syncr.circadia-lab.uk/reference/sync.md) joins
  tallieR, slumbR, and zeitR outputs in a single call
- 🧩 **Flexible joining** — left, inner, or full join strategies to suit
  your study design
- 🪪 **Participant-indexed** — all outputs keyed on a shared participant
  ID column
- 🧹 **Tidy output** — returns a clean tibble ready for modelling or
  export
- 🔧 **Source-agnostic** — supply any combination of sources; omitted
  sources are silently ignored

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- R ≥ 4.1
- `dplyr`, `rlang`, `cli`

### Installation

``` r
# Install from GitHub
remotes::install_github("circadia-bio/syncR")
```

### Basic usage

``` r
library(syncR)

db <- sync(
  tallie = tallieR::export(),   # sociodemographics + questionnaires
  slumb  = slumbR::export(),    # sleep diaries
  zeit   = zeitR::export()      # actigraphy + circadian metrics
)
```

### Joining strategies

``` r
# Inner join — only participants present in all sources
db <- sync(tallie = ..., slumb = ..., zeit = ..., join = "inner")

# Full join — all participants, NAs where data is absent
db <- sync(tallie = ..., slumb = ..., zeit = ..., join = "full")
```
